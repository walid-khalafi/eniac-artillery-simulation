# eniac-artillery-simulation
A modern C# re‑implementation of ENIAC’s WWII artillery firing table calculations, using real ballistic data for a 155 mm howitzer. Simulates projectile motion with gravity, drag, and atmospheric conditions to produce range and flight‑time tables instantly — a task that once required a 30‑ton computer and days of computation.
